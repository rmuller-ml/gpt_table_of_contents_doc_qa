    "# Question/answering  long documents by summarizing them into a table of contents  using GPT/Langchain\n",
    "\n",
    "TLDR: This notebook shows how to use GPT to answer questions from a big document that has does not have an available index. It is done in 3 steps: (1) Create a table of contents by summarizing chunks of texts (2) for a given question, ask GPT which summary in the index to look for the answer (2) get the full content used to generate the summary and include in the question/prompt so the answer can refer to the content (context) to better answer the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "With the availability of the GPT API, we can get natural language answers from data crawled by OpenAI. However, to get answers from private documents, we need to finetune the GPT model on the private documents or include those documents in the context of the question. If the document is too large for the context (maximum 4096 tokens, resulting in max ~3000 words including the answer) we need to be able to first find the sections of the document that may contain the answer. There are many ways to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Split the document into chunks\n",
    "Embedd this text chunks using GPT\n",
    "Embedd the question and use as context the chunk(s) with maximum cosine distance between chunk and question embedding\n",
    "See https://platform.openai.com/docs/tutorials/web-qa-embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the table of contents/index (this notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) If data is already organized with a table of contents, go to 2. If not, we can split the full document into chunks and summarize each chunk using a LLM to create a table of contents. This can be done by using summarization and chunking from Langchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) If the document is structured using sections (table of contents), we can ask the LLM (for a given question)to answer teh user question assuming the knowledge of the table of contents including the \"source\" (which section contains the answer). This can be done using https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/indexes/chain_examples/qa_with_sources.html (QA with sources from Langchain).\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Then we can refine the answer. We can include the text content of the section into a second question which will help to answer the user's question.\n",
    "\n",
    "More\n",
    "\n",
    "For the case where we already have a table of contents and we do not want to use Langchain, see: https://github.com/rmuller-ml/gpt_table_of_contents_doc_qa/blob/main/Search_GPT_API_documentation_with_GPT.ipynb"
